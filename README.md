# NeuralNets
A repo for (mostly group) work done in Neural Networks class at LSU.


hw 1:

Write a program to implement perceptron learning algorithm. 
Assume there are R inputs and S neurons in the neural network.  
Verify the learning using data given below.

hw 3:

Hebbian Learning / PseudoInverse Algorithm

proj 2:

Use the LMS algorithm to implement a Noise Cancellation neural network using an Adaptive Filter
